// This imports the Dart Sentry.io client that sends crash reports to Sentry.io.
//import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

// This file does not exist in the repository and is .gitignored. In your local
// clone of this repository, create this file and add a top-level [String]
// constant containing the DSN value issued by Sentry.io to your project.
//
// This method of supplying DSN is only for demo purposes. In a real app you
// might want to get it using a more robust method, such as via environment
// variables, a configuration file or a platform-specific secret key storage.
//import 'dsn.dart';

/// Sentry.io client used to send crash reports (or more generally "events").
///
/// This client uses the default client parameters. For example, it uses a
/// plain HTTP client that does not retry failed report attempts and does
/// not support offline mode. You might want to use a different HTTP client,
/// one that has these features. Please read the documentation for the
/// [SentryClient] constructor to learn how you can customize it.
///
/// [SentryClient.environmentAttributes] are particularly useful in a real
/// app. Use them to specify attributes of your app that do not change from
/// one event to another, such as operating system type and version, the
/// version of Flutter, and [device information][1].
///
/// [1]: https://github.com/flutter/plugins/tree/master/packages/device_info

/// reports from dev mode are not very useful, as these happen on developers'
/// workspaces rather than on users' devices in production.
